# Welcome to the Allen Arcade.

This was my final project for AP Computer Science A. I was fortunate<sub>(?)</sub> to have Mr. James Andrew Allen as my wise, allknowing muse.

I have prepared for you a wonderful set of experiences. Venture forth with an open mind. Also, bring a friend. Most of them are probably multiplayer.

---


## Running
This experience is intended to compile and run in Visual Studio Code. **Ensure you have Java installed.** `java` and `javac` are required to be on your PATH.

To run the arcade, clone and/or open this repository in Visual Studio Code. Run the `Compile Files` task to compile the Java and then run with the `Run Project` task.

For more information on Visual Studio Code tasks, please refer to the [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).


## Known Issues
Please only type choices presented in menus. Due to a bug in Java, invalid inputs will invoke evil.

Also, the games aren't finished. I'll get to it one day.


## Issues
Report bugs in an [Issue on the GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/frqstbite/allen_arcade/issues). They may be acted upon. Maybe.
